# My snippets

### My snippets is a web application that allows you to save your code snippets in a simple way.

This project was created with the intention of practicing the use of React, Typescript, Node, Express...

The application is still in beta version, so it is possible that you will find some bugs. If you find any, please report it to me on my github page/repo. **[Github Repository](https://github.com/bengar-dev/my-snippets)**

If you have any suggestions for improvement, please let me know.

**Beta will run until the end of the year 2023**, then the application will be in production, but don't worry you will not loose your snippets. 😉

<u>Live beta application is available here</u> : **[my-snippets](https://my-snippets-alpha.vercel.app)**
