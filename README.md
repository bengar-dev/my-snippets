## My snippets

Tool for managing and saving code snippets.

Initially, it was a personal tool that I decided to release for all developer users. As a junior developer, I used to save all my code snippets and examples in a personal Discord server. However, this became a bit inconvenient, so I decided to create my own tool.

If you'd like to give it a try, you'll need a **GitHub account for authentication**. Once you have an account, adding your first snippet will be a breeze. There are numerous languages available, such as **JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Docker, Bash, Java, PHP**, and more languages are being added regularly.

<u>Live beta application is available here</u> : [my-snippets](https://my-snippets-alpha.vercel.app)
